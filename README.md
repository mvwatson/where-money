Not really sure where this is going. Sure it's about money. The first practical app is supposed to be Forward Cash Flow.
Something that shows your expected cash position in the future.

However, I don't want your data. So I was going to make it a pure JS app that required you to export and import your 
data in each session.

Still under consideration.
